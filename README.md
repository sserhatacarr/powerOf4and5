# Powers of 4 and 5 Calculator

## Introduction

This Java program calculates and displays the powers of 4 and 5 up to a user-defined limit. It prompts the user to enter a limit number and then prints the powers of 4 and 5 until they exceed the limit.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `Main.java` file.
2. Compile the Java program using `javac Main.java`.
3. Run the program using `java Main`.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a limit number.
2. It calculates and prints the powers of 4 and 5 in separate sections.
3. The program continues calculating and printing until both powers exceed the limit.
4. It displays each power as "Base^Exponent = Result."

## Example

Please enter a limit number : 100
4^0 = 1
4^1 = 4
4^2 = 16
5^0 = 1
5^1 = 5
5^2 = 25
5^3 = 125
